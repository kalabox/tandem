Here's a basic shocker: all of those times you've installed a plugin or pasted some Javascript into to connect Google Analytics, you _may_ have been breaking Google's terms of service!

## Google's Requirements for Using Analytics

Basic language:

"You will not and will not assist or permit any third party to, pass information to Google that Google could use or recognize as personally identifiable information. You will have and abide by an appropriate Privacy Policy and will comply with all applicable laws, policies, and regulations relating to the collection of information from Visitors. You must post a Privacy Policy and that Privacy Policy must provide notice of Your use of cookies that are used to collect data. You must disclose the use of Google Analytics, and how it collects and processes data. This can be done by displaying a prominent link to the site “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps”, (located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, or any other URL Google may provide from time to time). You will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that a Visitor is provided with clear and comprehensive information about, and consents to, the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on the Visitor’s device where such activity occurs in connection with the Service and where providing such information and obtaining such consent is required by law."

--> [Google Analytics Terms of Use, Section 7: Privacy](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html)



Breaking that down into actionable items:

### Notify Your Users of Cookie Use

Notifying users about cookie use is required in the European Union and [some US states](reference needed), so if you don't fulfill this requirement already, this addition is overdue. At the very least, add a statement to your privacy policy noting your use of cookies that are used to collect data. If you want to comply with the EU rules, you'll need a [more prominent warning](reference needed) to users. Language like the following is common:

This site uses Google Analytics to track non-identifiable "General Information" (as defined in Section 10).This information may include but is not limited to the time of your visit, pages visited on the site, browser technology used, and operating system used. 

Determine which domain to measure
Distinguish unique users
Throttle the request rate
Remember the number and time of previous visits
Remember traffic source information
Determine the start and end of a session
Remember the value of visitor-level custom variables

This site also uses cookies .


11. General information

CVT routinely gathers quantitative information on website activity, including the number of
users to the site, pages visited, operating system, and browser version. No personally identifiable information is collected in this
routine activity, and CVT reserves the right to use, share or disclose this information with others. CVT uses the Google Analytics service to collect and store this information; more information on Google Analytic's privacy policy can be found [here](www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners).

Some of this General Information may be stored in cookies on your browser, including information to distinguish unique users, remember the number and time of previous visits, remember traffic source information, and determine the start and end of a session.
